# üí° VehicleRental - Client application made with JSP M2 and Java Servlet technology

# ‚öôÔ∏è Specification

The beginning page contains a login form. If the login was successful, a page opens with 4 options: scooter rental, bicycle rental, car rental and profile view. When the rental option is selected, the user enters the required data (location detection - manual or automatic), selects the vehicle type, makes a payment (via a payment card and confirmation of payment) and starts the ride. During the ride, a screen is displayed showing the payment amount and ride time (hour) and an option to end the ride. On the profile page, the client can change their password, deactivate their account and view all their rentals. The application must be implemented using JSP M2. This application cannot use the RESTful Spring Boot API service. The use of ready-made libraries for user interface design is allowed. The appearance of the application must be primarily adapted to devices with small screens.

This application is made using JSP M2 with Bootstrap.
